## Project Description

Our web app will use the phone's camera to find a QR code within the NOTL Museum, and will give the user a historical look at the item in front of them using AR.
The goal of this project is to teach visitors of the NOTL Museum about the unique history and culture that the Niagara region holds.

## Timetable

The team has decided to work in an Agile Environment. Each sprint is divided into two weeks long.
The overall timeline to build this application is 12 weeks.

### Notes

> Sprint 0 is a short sprint to align with the team to discuss on the basic structure of the application.
>
> Sprint 7 is a short sprint to add any final touches to the application based on feedback from the user.
>
> Project format
>
> **Components**: A component is the smallest section of the app that repeats on other screens. Creating components first will help us put pages together easily. We will not have to repeat our work for another screen.
>
> **Pages**: Once we have all the components ready, we can start building the pages. A page will have one or more components.
